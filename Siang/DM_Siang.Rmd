####**Question 4:** Does the store distance affect the customer spending and their order methods?

#####**Part 1** - Store Distance vs Order Methods

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = 200, out.height= 200, fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 1: Average Store Distance"}
knitr::include_graphics("ordermethod.png")
```

Figure 1 shows the average distance from the customerâ€™s address to the nearest company store and the results were broken down by the type of their order methods. Comparing to the channels of internet, mail and phone, customers who purchase products via retail channel (store) generally have an address that is nearest to the store. Customers who purchase through mail via catalog channel have the highest average store distance. Overall, customers who do not purchase directly at the retail store live relatively far away from their nearest company store.

#####**Part 2** - Store Distance vs Customer Spending

**2.1 Sum of dollars spent**

The total spend of each customer was calculated to investigate the relationship between store distance and the total amount of money they spent on the products. The amount of money spent by the customers was split into different order channels, that is, retail store, internet, mail and phone. Phone and mail are the two methods by which catalog channel orders are placed. Linear regression and scatter plot were then employed to investigate the relationship and identify the trend.

**2.1.1** Internet 
```{r}
model211 <- lm(sum_dollar_internet~StoreDist)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = 300, out.height= 300, fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 2: Sum of spending via internet"}
knitr::include_graphics("s_internet.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(tidy(model211), caption = "Table 1: Coefficients", digits = 3)
kable(glance(model211), caption = "Table 2: Regression Statistics", digits = 3)
```

**2.1.2** Retail Store 
```{r}
model212 <- lm(sum_dollar_retail~StoreDist)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = 300, out.height= 300, fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 3: Sum of spending via retail store"}
knitr::include_graphics("s_store.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(tidy(model212), caption = "Table 3: Coefficients", digits = 3)
kable(glance(model212), caption = "Table 4: Regression Statistics", digits = 3)
```

**2.1.3** Mail 
```{r}
model213 <- lm(sum_dollar_mail~StoreDist)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = 300, out.height= 300, fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 4: Sum of spending via catalog (Mail)"}
knitr::include_graphics("s_mail.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(tidy(model213), caption = "Table 5: Coefficients", digits = 3)
kable(glance(model213), caption = "Table 6: Regression Statistics", digits = 3)
```

**2.1.4** Phone
```{r}
model214 <- lm(sum_dollar_phone~StoreDist)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = 300, out.height= 300, fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 5: Sum of spending via catalog (Phone)"}
knitr::include_graphics("s_phone.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(tidy(model214), caption = "Table 7: Coefficients", digits = 3)
kable(glance(model214), caption = "Table 8: Regression Statistics", digits = 3)
```

Results for all four scenarios are similar. Although the p-values of store distance in all four models are very significant, the R-squared and estimate are considerably low. That implies the independent variable - store distance might be statistically significant but it is not economically significant at all, which was also supported by the scatter plot where no trend was observed in the graphs.


**Part 2.2 Frequency of Purchase**

A new attempt to investigate the relationship between customer spending and store distance was made, the variable of dollar spent was replaced with frequency of purchase made by customers. The identical methodology and data segmentation was used for the following analysis.

**2.2.1** Retail Store
```{r}
model221 <- lm(ST~StoreDist)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = 300, out.height= 300, fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 6: Frequency of purchase via retail store"}
knitr::include_graphics("f_store.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(tidy(model221), caption = "Table 9: Coefficients", digits = 3)
kable(glance(model221), caption = "Table 10: Regression Statistics", digits = 3)
```

**2.2.2** Phone
```{r}
model222 <- lm(P~StoreDist)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = 300, out.height= 300, fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 7: Frequency of purchase via phone"}
knitr::include_graphics("f_phone.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(tidy(model222), caption = "Table 11: Coefficients", digits = 3)
kable(glance(model222), caption = "Table 12: Regression Statistics", digits = 3)
```

**2.2.3** Mail
```{r}
model223 <- lm(M~StoreDist)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = 300, out.height= 300, fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 8: Frequency of purchase via mail"}
knitr::include_graphics("f_mail.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(tidy(model223), caption = "Table 13: Coefficients", digits = 3)
kable(glance(model223), caption = "Table 14: Regression Statistics", digits = 3)
```

**2.2.4** Internet
```{r}
model224 <- lm(I~StoreDist)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = 300, out.height= 300, fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 9: Frequency of purchase via internet"}
knitr::include_graphics("f_internet.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(tidy(model224), caption = "Table 15: Coefficients", digits = 3)
kable(glance(model224), caption = "Table 16: Regression Statistics", digits = 3)
```

Similar to the results from part 1, the variable store distance is not economically significant in all four scenarios, estimate and R-squared are very low in any cases. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is no direct relationship between store distance and customer spending, that is, customers do not spend more based on the store distance.
